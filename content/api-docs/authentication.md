# Authentication

## Overview

Authentication is a crucial part of accessing the API. It ensures that only authorized users can access certain endpoints and perform actions on the server.

## Authentication Method

The API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. To access protected resources, you must include a valid token in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

### Request Format

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Obtaining an Access Token

To obtain an access token, you need to authenticate using your credentials. Follow these steps:

1. **Send a POST request** to the authentication endpoint:

   ```
   POST /api/v1/auth/login
   ```

   **Request Body:**
   ```json
   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

2. **Receive the access token** in the response:

   **Response:**
   ```json
   {
       "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
       "expires_in": 3600
   }
   ```

## Token Expiration

Access tokens are valid for a limited time (e.g., 1 hour). After expiration, you must request a new token using the login process.

## Refreshing Tokens

If your API supports refresh tokens, you can obtain a new access token without re-entering your credentials. Send a POST request to the refresh endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "refresh_token": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "access_token": "NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

## Error Handling

If authentication fails, the API will return an error response. Common error codes include:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid credentials or token.
- **403 Forbidden**: Token is valid but does not have permission to access the requested resource.

Make sure to handle these errors appropriately in your application.
